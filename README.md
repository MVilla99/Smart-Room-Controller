smart room controller for use with wemo smart plugs and hue lightbulbs. ( among other things).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For general use, see the user manual option under the main menu when the controller is initialized.
to begin initialization, click the button once. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILE DEFINITION:
The files of "wemo_hue_set" and "tie in test code" are both code written to test 
fucntionality of integrating different components. they have no bearing on the actual
smart room controller and are there mearly for seeing the logic I had while 
integrating a few different systems. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PARTS LIST:
The parts list file is used as a reference to the parts I used during this 
project. They are more akin to what I actually used than what is uploaded on Hackster.io
as Hackster didnt necissarily have the exact parts used. 

SCHEMATICS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Schematics of the controller can be found under the Smart Room Controller Fritzing file
they contain a .fzz that may be opened in fritzing for the schematic at time of writing (1-august-2020).
the schematic is subject to change on what is in the final product based on wether or not I 
include internal lighting and where i may choose to move the servo.
